Questions:

1. What is log odds of probability?

======
2. What do we model in a Logistic Regression?

======
3. What is the loss function?

======
4. What is the ouput of LR?
======
5. Is it classification or regression?
It is used for classification as it provides information on the probabality of a positive event in a binary classification scenario.  
======
6. Is it high bias or high variance model?
======
7. Why do we use a sigmoid function for LR?
======
8. How do we interpret the LR model's result?
======
9. How do we regularize it?
======
10. Shape of decision boundary in LR?
======
11. How do we tune a LR model without changing the parameters?
======
12. What is the current implementation of LR in sklearn? Is it based on least squared?
======
13. Is scaling required in logistic regression? And if yes, how  do we interpret the weights from a LR model?
