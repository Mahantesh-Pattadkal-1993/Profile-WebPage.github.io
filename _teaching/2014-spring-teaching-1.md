Here I answer a list of fundamental questions on Logistic Regression.

Rescoures: [Blog](https://yury-zablotski.netlify.app//post/from-odds-to-probability/)

Questions:

---
1. **What is log odds of probability?**
---

2. **What do we model in a Logistic Regression?**
---

3. **What is the loss function?**
---

4. **What is the ouput of LR?**
---
5. **Is it classification or regression?**
---

It is used for classification as it provides information on the probabality of a positive event in a binary classification scenario.

6. **Is it high bias or high variance model?**
---
7. **Why do we use a sigmoid function for LR?**
---
8. **How do we interpret the LR model's result?**
---
9. **How do we regularize it?**
---
10. **Shape of decision boundary in LR?**
---
11. **How do we tune a LR model without changing the parameters?**
---
12. **What is the current implementation of LR in sklearn? Is it based on least squared?**
---
13. **Is scaling required in logistic regression? And if yes, how  do we interpret the weights from a LR model?**
